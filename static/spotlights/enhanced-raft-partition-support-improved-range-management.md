We've made significant improvements to our raft partition support system to enhance scalability and reliability. The changes include combining SplitConfig and disk.Partition for a more unified configuration approach, fixing critical bugs in end key handling for the last range descriptor in partitions, and adding new methods for efficient range descriptor lookups by partition.

Key enhancements include a new method for reserving multiple range IDs at once, reducing overhead in partition setup. We've also refactored the bring-up code to separate meta range initialization from partition initialization, making the system more modular and allowing the driver to handle partition-specific operations more efficiently.

To improve atomicity, all range descriptors in a partition are now written within a single transaction, preventing scenarios where partitions could end up in partially configured states. An ongoing pull request will further refactor the driver to support partition-level tasks and streamline partition initialization workflows.
