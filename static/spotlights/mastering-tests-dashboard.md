# Mastering the Tests Dashboard

BuildBuddy's Tests tab is a powerful testing analytics and debugging platform that helps you understand test performance, track flakiness, and diagnose failures across your entire codebase.

## Key Features

### 🔍 Advanced Filtering & Search
- **Smart search**: Find tests by name, target, or failure messages
- **Status filtering**: Focus on failed, flaky, or slow tests
- **Date range selection**: Analyze test trends over time
- **Target patterns**: Filter by Bazel target patterns like `//src/...`
- **Tag-based filtering**: Group tests by custom tags and labels

### 📊 Test Analytics & Insights
- **Flakiness detection**: Automatically identify unreliable tests
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor test duration trends and regressions
- **Success rate metrics**: Track test reliability over time
- **Historical comparison**: Compare test performance across builds
- **Failure clustering**: Group similar failures for easier debugging

### 🐛 Debugging Tools
- **Detailed logs**: Access complete test output and error messages
- **Execution timeline**: Visualize test execution phases
- **Resource usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage during tests
- **Artifacts browser**: Access test outputs, screenshots, and generated files
- **Stack trace analysis**: Navigate directly to failing code locations

## Power User Tips

### 1. Create Custom Test Dashboards
Bookmark filtered views for different teams or test suites:
```
/tests?filter=//frontend/... status:failed date:last-week
/tests?filter=//backend/... tag:integration
```

### 2. Set Up Intelligent Alerts
Configure notifications for:
- Tests that become consistently flaky
- New test failures in critical paths
- Performance regressions beyond thresholds

### 3. Leverage Test Grid Views
Switch between list and grid views to:
- **List view**: Detailed analysis of individual test runs
- **Grid view**: High-level overview of test health across targets

### 4. Use Advanced Query Syntax
Master the search syntax for precise filtering:
- `status:failed OR status:flaky` - Multiple status conditions
- `duration:>30s` - Tests slower than 30 seconds  
- `target://...integration_test` - Specific target patterns
- `date:2024-02-01..2024-02-15` - Custom date ranges

## Integration Workflows

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- **Pre-merge checks**: Review test results before code integration
- **Release validation**: Ensure test suite health before deployments
- **Regression detection**: Catch performance and reliability issues early

### Team Collaboration
- **Shared bookmarks**: Create team-specific test views
- **Issue linking**: Connect failing tests to bug tracking systems
- **Performance reviews**: Use trends data in sprint retrospectives

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Health Checks**: Review flaky tests weekly and fix or quarantine them
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up alerts for tests exceeding duration thresholds
3. **Failure Triage**: Use failure clustering to efficiently address related issues
4. **Historical Analysis**: Compare test metrics across releases to identify trends

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to Tests tab** in your BuildBuddy dashboard
2. **Apply filters** to focus on your team's test suite
3. **Bookmark useful views** for quick access
4. **Set up notifications** for critical test failures
5. **Explore test details** to understand performance characteristics

The Tests dashboard transforms raw test data into actionable insights, helping you maintain a healthy, fast, and reliable test suite that scales with your development team.
