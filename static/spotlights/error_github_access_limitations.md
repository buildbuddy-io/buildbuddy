I'm not able to directly access GitHub URLs or browse the internet to read the pull request you mentioned (PR: 10042). To help you create the product highlight blurb, I would need you to:

1. Copy and paste the PR description and key changes from the GitHub pull request, or
2. Provide the repository name/organization so I can better understand the context

Once you share the PR content, I'll be happy to create a technical product highlight with the markdown format you specified.
