BuildBuddy exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics that allow monitoring the
[four golden signals](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/):
latency, traffic, errors, and saturation.

Prometheus metrics are exposed under the path `metrics/` on port `9090` by default.

To view these metrics in a live-updating dashboard, we recommend using a tool
like [Grafana](https://grafana.com).
