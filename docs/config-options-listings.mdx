import FreeServerConfig from '../bazel-bin/server/cmd/buildbuddy/yaml_doc/buildbuddy_server_documented_defaults.mdx'
import EnterpriseServerConfig from '../bazel-bin/enterprise/server/cmd/server/yaml_doc/buildbuddy_enterprise_server_documented_defaults.mdx'
import ExecutorConfig from '../bazel-bin/enterprise/server/cmd/executor/yaml_doc/buildbuddy_executor_documented_defaults.mdx'

Provided below are working, documented YAML configs for each Buildbuddy binary
containing every option that that binary accepts, each set to the default value
for that option. Any option that can be specified in the YAML config can also be
passed on the command line. For nested options, be sure to write out the full
YAML path, with a `.` separating each part.

For example:
```yaml
storage:
    disk:
        root_directory: /tmp/buildbuddy
```
becomes:
```sh
buildbuddy -storage.disk.root_directory="/tmp/buildbuddy"
```
