For cloud users, BuildBuddy exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics 
to monitor and alert on their usage.

In order to fetch Prometheus metrics, you can add the following [scrape config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) in
your Prometheus configuration:
```
global:
  scrape_interval: 30s
scrape_configs
  - job_name: buildbuddy
    scheme: https
    authorization:
      type: "x-buildbuddy-api-key"
      credentials: "<buildbuddy_api_key>"
    metrics_path: "/api/v1/metrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["app.buildbuddy.io"]
```


To view these metrics in a live-updating dashboard, we recommend using a tool
like [Grafana](https://grafana.com).
