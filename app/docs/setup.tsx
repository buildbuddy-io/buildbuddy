          To get started, select options below then copy the results to your <b>.bazelrc</b> file.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you don't have a <b>.bazelrc</b> file - create one in the same directory as your Bazel <b>WORKSPACE</b>{" "}
          file.
          <h2>1. Configure your .bazelrc</h2>
          <SetupCodeComponent />
          <h2>2. Verify your installation</h2>
          Once you've added those lines to your <b>.bazelrc</b>, kick off a bazel build.
          <br />
          <br />
          You'll get a BuildBuddy URL printed at the beginning and the end of every Bazel invocation like this:
          <code>
            bazel build //...
            <br />
            INFO: Streaming build results to: {bbURL}/invocation/7bedd84e-525e-4b93-a5f5-53517d57752b
            <br />
            ...
          </code>
          Now you can âŒ˜ click / double click on these urls to see the results of your build!
