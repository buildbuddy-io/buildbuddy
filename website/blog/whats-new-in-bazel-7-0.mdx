[Bazel 7.0][bazel-7-0] includes [over 3,700 changes][diff] since 6.0.
It's the latest major release,
following the release of 6.0 in December of last year,
and it's Bazel's [fourth LTS release][lts-releases].

[bazel-7-0]: https://blog.bazel.build/2023/12/11/bazel-7-release.html
[diff]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/6.0.0...7.0.0
[lts-releases]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/release

Since there were so many changes,
many of them quite impactful,
I felt I needed to review them all and provide a nice summary for y'all.

<!-- truncate -->

While I reviewed every change,
I didn't _understand_ every change üòÖ.
I just wanted to mention that,
since this isn't an exhaustive list of changes,
but it is a lot of changes I felt were relevant to a large portion of the community.
Also, this year I've included changes that appeared in the Bazel 6 minor releases
(e.g. Bazel 6.1).
While you might already be on a version greater than 6.0,
you might not know about all of the neat changes that made it into these "minor" releases.

Similar to [Bazel 6.0's changes][whats-new-in-bazel-6],
the end result was quite big,
so I've included a table of contents to allow easy navigation to the changes that interest you the most:

## Command-line flag changes

Bazel's [LTS strategy][lts-releases] allows for breaking changes between major versions.
In particular,
it allows for command-line flags to be removed,
renamed,
made to do nothing,
or have their default values changed.
In the following sections I collected all such flag changes I could find.

### Renamed

### Undeprecated

Surprisingly, a flag was undeprecated in Bazel 7.0:

- `--allowed_local_actions_regex` ([a1dcaea](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/a1dcaea019a63c13dbe10bfd07861fa0beae19b7))

## Remote

One of Bazel's most powerful features is its ability to use [remote caching and remote execution][remote-explained].
Numerous improvements and fixes to Bazel's remote capabilities made it into Bazel since 6.0.

Below are some changes that weren't tied to any specific remote feature
(e.g. gRPC connections):

[remote-explained]: bazels-remote-caching-and-remote-execution-explained.md

- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Added the `--remote_retry_max_delay` flag, which allows remote retry max delay to be user configurable. ([060fea5](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/060fea547102b8bdb31b9b5a6396208227bf6c53))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Added the `--experimental_circuit_breaker_strategy`, `--experimental_remote_failure_rate_threshold`, and `--experimental_remote_failure_window_interval` flags, which causes Bazel to stop using the remote cache or remote execution after a certain rate of failures. ([5575ff2](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5575ff24aff3c2ba6e487158f8d79f72d86e6800), [10fb5f6](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/10fb5f6c39b945fe280e2d694c1be1a53d326810))
- <VersionPill version="6.4.0"/> The `digest_function` field is now set as part of all relevant gRPC requests. ([0a8380b](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/0a8380bec9dceae1bffabddcccd459e82d8674b1))

### Remote caching (RBC)

Using a remote cache is one of the most popular ways of speeding up a Bazel build.
Thankfully these changes make using a remote cache both more performant and more reliable:

- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Added the `--incompatible_remote_use_new_exit_code_for_lost_inputs` flag, which causes Bazel to exit with code 39 if the remote cache evicted blobs that Bazel needed. ([99cff33](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/99cff33e955bd5ceb9a7802b9bd161200c6d7a28))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Background download progress is now reported in the UI. ([0f524c6](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/0f524c63f3ea769793c4b801bc2dc882570cffc4))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Bazel now cleans up stale metadata when it detects that remote cache blobs have been evicted. ([963640a](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/963640a8d75747c3891911940566cc115eacc340), [32e4f23](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/32e4f23ec67909e92313be4d3334b62ccb490d55), [c05ba76](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/c05ba7658b36f44bbd77e949c9b13092af06c038))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> When using a combined cache, the AC integrity check now applies to disk part as well. ([5f2866f](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5f2866f8434ce9a17cf82c001efb7b236f189115))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Fixed `--remote_download_minimal` to work with `bazel test`. ([e8182ce](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e8182ce32931560406fee1c30745e56a2ee9a6b3))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Added the `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` flag, which automatically retries the build if it encounters a remote cache eviction error. ([24b4589](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/24b45890c431de98d586fdfe5777031612049135))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> All remote metadata is now cleared if any blobs are detected as evicted from the remote cache. ([49a9502](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/49a9502312b6af391a10e1a5c3e05d245ad54899))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Removed `action_id` metadata from prefetched inputs. ([f62a8b9](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f62a8b9f6a7e840c648f44f094390c3b85b236df))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> `ALREADY_EXISTS` when uploading is now treated as a success. ([daa3dbe](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/daa3dbe22adb03338c75b53ea97954c9434099b4))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Improved the upload early return logic. ([50ec6bb](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/50ec6bbff08cc00de4dfdea68e7483f383674222))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Fixed failures creating output directories. ([4050120](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/405012066d2394ad9986830ca028badd3c65ad38))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is now disabled if `--invocation_id` is set. ([d9b94cb](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d9b94cbc86a5eb063974c159d404cce68ee56409))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Output symlinks are now gracefully handled when using Build without the Bytes. ([ca30372](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ca30372e210a638cfce8334b6dc3396c83424baa))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> The `prefetecher` `action_id` metadata is now set for prefected inputs. ([3b39ab8](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3b39ab8e0b0cc91a4970141eaa3469047076dcca))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Fixed local action non-declared symlink issue when using Build without the Bytes. ([5c4cf47](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5c4cf47a131c84506aad9ce0e014c6643c31a4ac))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Fixed a potential memory leak in the UI. ([ce8836d](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ce8836dd05de94b92a494be12a47a56bf9819107))
- <VersionPill version="6.4.0"/> Added the `--experimental_remote_require_cached` flag, which fails the build if any remotely cachable actions aren't cached. ([22f518c](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/22f518c04babd1b01cdacfbdda7c1781558fc508))

### Remote execution (RBE)

For some projects,
using remote execution is the ultimate performance unlock for their Bazel builds.
In addition to the remote caching changes covered above,
which also apply to remote execution,
the following changes improve the remote execution experience:

- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Added the `--experimental_remote_discard_merkle_trees` flag, which discards in-memory copies of the input root's Merkle tree and associated input mappings during calls to `GetActionResult` and `Execute`. ([4069a87](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/4069a87611886532a19c7e558ab4c2f1e83f53f0))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Made Bazel more responsive and use less memory when `--jobs` is set to a high value. ([4069a87](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/4069a87611886532a19c7e558ab4c2f1e83f53f0))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Fixed handling of remote cache eviction when uploading inputs. ([c1168e1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/c1168e13965ccd61ae9d948cf1e30bcdf459ae6a))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Optimized building Merkle trees. ([f63ce79](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f63ce7973b8f3f2560f41daf7321a40d20b22fab), [6d6fa81](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/6d6fa81e47591f41b9dce5e2a9a8512ec13d3f4a))
- <VersionPill version="6.2.0"/> Tree artifacts are now included in the Merkle cache. ([0f55d12](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/0f55d124c05ee2654c3ff56e0332e71ff1eb437c))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Added support for `output_symlinks` in `ActionResult`. ([e842fd5](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e842fd5197bfa549c6ec70696d62b024deabb09d), [d3fb047](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d3fb04748392addf2568d1e9fa1db7e8262a2b49))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Remote symlink outputs are now supported when using building without the bytes. ([0ff6b88](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/0ff6b88d8ade0a539a101d8428d35cd004523472))
- <VersionPill version="6.4.0"/> The `no-remote-exec` execution requirement is now part of the action salt. ([5a23ab2](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5a23ab2f6416b7ed450bb7b0a59d7aa0f68eea8d))

### Dynamic execution

[Dynamic execution][dynamic-execution] allows for Bazel to race remote and local execution of actions,
potentially allowing you to get the benefit of both modes,
without the drawbacks of either.
Bazel 7.0 only included a single notable user-facing change to dynamic execution:

[dynamic-execution]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/remote/dynamic

- Added the `--experimental_dynamic_ignore_local_signals` flag, which allows local failures under dynamic execution to be ignored for exit codes > 127 (signals). ([07ee4b7](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/07ee4b7c566c46c259ef050a1eedbde4a1d4ab5f))

### Build Event Service (BES)

Using a build event service can give you unparalleled insight into your Bazel builds at scale.
There were a couple nice changes to BES support:

- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> stdout and stderr logs are now uploaded when using `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload=minimal`. ([17b8e44](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/17b8e448a5e5589f96c2794cb38c86b0c64e86c0))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> When using `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload=minimal`, `bytestream://` is always used for BEP referenced files. ([b0c5eb3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b0c5eb30b2738bf6454c3026a3e0f37579d5854c))
- Added the `--bes_system_keywords` flag, which allows specifying non-prefixed notification keywords. ([8daa3dc](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8daa3dc47cf6a1803350eb249709d847f945d25f))
- Added the `--build_event_{binary,json,text}_file_upload_mode` flags, which specify the upload mode to use for each file type. ([ca62ca1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ca62ca133459ad83f2b886b20fb02e8f100a386a))

## Logging

Bazel offers various methods to gain insight into your build.
I cover some of the notable changes to those methods below.

### Build Event Protocol (BEP)

The build event protocol is used by [build event services](#build-event-service-bes),
so all of these changes could have also been listed in that section as well.
The BEP can also be collected locally with [`--build_event_json_file`][build_event_json_file], [`--build_event_binary_file`][build_event_binary_file], and [`--build_event_text_file`][build_event_text_file].

[build_event_binary_file]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--build_event_binary_file
[build_event_json_file]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--build_event_json_file
[build_event_text_file]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--build_event_text_file

The vast majority of changes added additional information to the BEP,
though some are fixes and improvements:

- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Added the `action_cache_statistics` field to `BuildMetrics.ActionSummary`. ([7963528](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/79635280a69c92085674c448f2a2f72f8ed1d442))

### Timing profile

The action timing profile,
which is enabled by default with [`--profile`][profile],
is viewable both [locally in Chrome][performance-profiling] and on [build event services](#build-event-service-bes).
These changes add more detail and clarity to the profile:

[performance-profiling]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/advanced/performance/json-trace-profile

### Execution log

Bazel logs all of the [spawns][spawns] it executes in the execution log,
which is enabled with the [`--execution_log_json_file`][execution_log_json_file] or [`--execution_log_binary_file`][execution_log_binary_file] flags.
This feature is relatively stable,
with just a few noticeable changes:

[execution_log_binary_file]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_binary_file
[execution_log_json_file]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_json_file
[spawns]: bazels-remote-caching-and-remote-execution-explained.md#spawns

- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Added the `--execution_log_sort` flag, which allows disabling execution log sorting. ([1a6ffe6](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/1a6ffe6d453708e3cefc98a07965c680e48d6bac))
- <VersionPill version="6.4.0"/> Added the `is_tool` field to `File`. ([0434287](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/04342878d02ed47735051c343a888eab591422af))
- `--execution_log_json_file` and `--execution_log_binary_file` are now mutually exclusive. ([61fa933](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/61fa9331099dbc73df4b9d51ad1143f23369d8a2))
- Renamed the `remote_cache_hit` field in `SpawnExec` to `cache_hit`. ([60dbc64](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/60dbc6436ede4088f953186bea74f023484fdb43))
- Removed the `progress_message` field from `SpawnExec`. ([0ca0510](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/0ca0510f42339bf30693ff3d4353f4ef198134db))
- Removed the `walltime` field from `SpawnExec`. ([60e03bf](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/60e03bf0535090e7c011180cdc95ba89942c2bbc))

### Execution graph

The execution graph,
which is enabled with the [`--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log`][experimental_enable_execution_graph_log] flag,
logs all actions executed during a build.
It differs from the [execution log](#execution-log) in that it contains additional information needed to reconstruct the full dependency graph.

[experimental_enable_execution_graph_log]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log

Even though there aren't many changes to the execution graph in Bazel 7.0,
I only recently learned about its existence,
and wanted to call attention to it:

- Added the `discover_inputs_millis` field to `Metrics`. ([0e099d9](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/0e099d92b4340f424e224c0b73ae8c111b3a409a))
- Added the `--experimental_execution_graph_enable_edges_from_filewrite_actions` flag, which adjusts how filewrite action edges are handled. ([4973166](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/49731660d8348d4ce243c4531bd5f3b14006f1df))
- Added the `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log` and `--experimental_execution_graph_log_path` flags, which replace the `--experimental_execution_graph_log` flag. ([8ab9c6e](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8ab9c6e5497ccfe88fdedb2c86ce0ae9461115dc))
- The execution graph is now written to the output base instead of the workspace. ([b5808a4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b5808a4c095102609e4dd1d480592aeda473dc24))
- Shared actions are now included in the execution graph. ([2036a0f](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2036a0f0fa093d6e48fc02431e28734907cfca63))
- Test actions no longer output an extra node. ([c3260c4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/c3260c4ec429664c44f0905518d3bb4057b10da3))

### Other

- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Changed `--memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters` to accept more than one GC specification. ([3dc6951](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3dc69515210897c00d645e323dff23dfd178970c))
- Added the `--experimental_command_profile` flag, which records a Java Flight Recorder CPU profile into a `profile.jfr` file in the output base. ([5cbb153](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5cbb153c839f13c07d777a0175e88dc8a1ab2780))

## Execution

Executing build commands is a primary function of Bazel.
Some execution related changes can be classified in a particular way,
such as [remote execution](#remote-execution-rbe)
or [dynamic execution](#dynamic-execution).
For the rest,
I've collected them here.

Below I summarize some foundational execution related changes,
including "local execution" strategies:

- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Added the `--experimental_writable_outputs` flag, which causes the permissions of all output files to `0755` instead of `0555`. ([88c426e](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/88c426e73cc0eb0a41c0d7995e36acd94e7c9a48))
- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> Added the `--local_extra_resources` flag, which allows specifying additional resource types that can limit concurrently running actions. ([2b2bea4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2b2bea4ee9d51ad875a8d273aa344ac9c5b6742c))

## Platforms

[Platforms][platforms] are where your build tools run (i.e. execution platforms)
or where your built products will run (i.e. target platforms).
In previous years I catagorized changes along those lines,
but this year I'm not making that distinction.

## Starlark and Build API

[Starlark][starlark] is the configuration language used to configure your project.
It is also the programming language used to define [rules][rules].
Bazel also has a Build API which defines standard functions,
modules,
and rules
that can be used from Starlark.
Here are some notable changes to both:

## Platforms and toolchains API

In Bazel 7.0 the C++, Android, and Apple rules completed their migration to support [building with Platforms][building-with-platforms].

[building-with-platforms]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/concepts/platforms

Here are some of the platforms and toolchains related changes which weren't tied to any of those migrations:

- <VersionPill version="6.1.0"/> `--platforms` is no longer cleared in transitions when no change is made to `--cpu`. ([5b4de12](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5b4de12b37cb4ba921b6bdfe810bbb47921ab3a6))

- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Credential helpers now apply to repository fetching as well. ([9731e69](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9731e6906cba63a1eba0c1fb335290d76efabf16))
- <VersionPill version="6.3.0"/> Wall-time is now used for credential helper invalidation. ([5f77aba](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5f77abaca0457d83a78e89ba1549196ce2f4d798))
- Added the `--experimental_include_default_values` flag, which includes default values for Starlark flags in the `canonicalize-flags` command. ([33e9bf1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/33e9bf119550950ebcf0ffb2c7b372c17748dd7d))

## Summary

As you can see,
Bazel 7.0 was another _massive_ release (20% larger than last year!).
Thankfully,
through the [rolling releases][rolling-releases] process,
people were able to test,
or even actively depend on,
these changes well before the first 7.0 release candidate was cut.

[rolling-releases]: https://bazel.build/versions/7.0.0/release#rolling-releases

Work on Bazel 8.0 is well underway,
and I look forward to summarizing its changes next year.
Until then, üëã.
