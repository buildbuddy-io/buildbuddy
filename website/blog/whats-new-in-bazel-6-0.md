[Bazel 6.0][bazel-6-0] includes [over 3,100 changes][diff] since 5.4.
It's the latest major release,
following the release of 5.0 in January of this year,
and it's Bazel's [third LTS release][lts-releases].
Since there were so many changes,
many of them quite impactful,
I felt I needed to review them all and provide a nice summary for y'all.

[bazel-6-0]: https://blog.bazel.build/2022/12/19/bazel-6.0.html
[diff]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/5.4.0...6.0.0
[lts-releases]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/release/versioning#lts-releases

<!-- truncate -->

Similar to [Bazel 5.0's changes][whats-new-in-bazel-5],
the end result was quite big,
so I've included a table of contents to allow easy navigation to the changes that interest you the most:

## Command-Line Flag Changes

Bazel's [LTS strategy][lts-releases] allows for breaking changes between major versions.
In particular,
it allows for command-line flags to be removed,
renamed,
made to do nothing,
or have their default values changed.
In the following sections I collected all such flag changes I could find.

### Renamed

- [`--experimental_build_transitive_python_runfiles` is now `--incompatible_build_transitive_python_runfiles`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/36afffa04151d9243051f83897c88257ab4d1026)

## Remote

One of Bazel's most powerful features is its ability to use [remote caching and remote execution][remote-explained].
Numerous improvements and fixes to Bazel's remote capabilities are included in Bazel 6.0.

[remote-explained]: bazels-remote-caching-and-remote-execution-explained.md

### Remote caching (RBC)

Using a remote cache is one of the most popular ways of speeding up a Bazel build.
Thankfully these changes make using a remote cache both more performant and more reliable:

- [Added the `--experimental_remote_downloader_local_fallback` flag, which causes the remote downloader to fallback to normal fetching.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/7b141c1edf243acae5859f56cd0afff2d3eaba32)
- [Added the `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` flag, which causes all values of a multi-value header to be sent with Remote Downloader.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b750f8c0242d7fcb581d368d8b75e59c51c13a61)
- [The `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` flag is now enabled by default when using the `--remote_download_*` flags.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e5f92a40338ffe0f50f817ee1b2b6e3557d380e2)
- [Outputs downloaded with `--experimental_remote_download_regex` no longer block spawn execution.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e01e7f51dd19f39ce3bc0718cec20ed6474de733)
- [`--experimental_remote_download_regex` now matches on execution root relative paths.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/bb8e6eca7a8698b2bb8216160038a36e55e69da7)
- [Top-level outputs are now always downloaded when using `--remote_download_toplevel`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b6f3111d8e460de35a5e5570bd784919fc30c5f8)
- [`bazel run` now works with `--remote_download_minimal`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/845077fff18432e6b2a1a089964e1afc9b9fec7f)
- [When using Build without the Bytes, AC results in the disk cache are now validated to be complete.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/21b0992eb26e91ad3e6d3046fa90f1f7ad8b9f08)
- [Outputs and stdErr are now always downloaded.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b303cd128d9f1d913749927f4a1cd942b10b1ae2)
- [Symlinked targets are no longer unnecessarily downloaded.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/32b0f5a258ee83b040d6975a6bd0795670f5cd47)
- [Downloads now use a priority system to improve critical path performance.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/05b97393ff7604f237d9d31bd63714f27fbe83f2)
- [HTTP remote caches now support client TLS authentication.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/aaf65b97b7cd75160b4b4dcc9149fb9fc60e1759)
- [Headers are no longer included in `FetchBlobRequest`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/7aa69a968b9063cb080417426a11bb32954f7f6c)
- [AC uploads will no longer error if `--remote_upload_local_results=true` and `GetCapabilities` returns `update_enabled=false`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f589512846c5762e89757b96835ee54da4bb2281)
- [Fixed hanging when failing to upload action inputs.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8b61746cf18d3d8413b569e0b5fca639d28914ea)

### Remote execution (RBE)

For some projects,
using remote execution is the ultimate performance unlock for their Bazel builds.
In addition to the remote caching changes covered above,
which also apply to remote execution,
the following changes improve the remote execution experience:

- [Added the `--experimental_remote_mark_tool_inputs` flag, which marks tool inputs for remote executors, which in turn allows them to implement remote persistent workers.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/72b481a8e9c19de1acf323c69d2d822c954a6dbb)
- [Added the `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` flag, which allows symlinks in action outputs to dangle.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5b46a48db8b380ba9afe2df2cb7d564b0c927913)
- [Added the `--remote_print_execution_messages` flag, which allows control over when to print remote execution messages.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8b57c5810f2cc58f71995be83604d47226cf9244)
- [Added the `exclusive-if-local` tag, for disabling parallel local test execution but allowing remote execution if requested.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8936828610db8106864e41860ad86c5c415fa0ed)
- [Added support for remotely generating unresolved symlinks.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ca95fecde07a28736ea815ec64bcd639a234d79c)
- [Fixed formatting of non-ASCII text.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/c55b01e3e4c535738f9aebbb4d1ba0623235aee0)

### Dynamic execution

[Dynamic execution][dynamic-execution] allows for Bazel to race remote and local execution of actions,
potentially allowing you to get the benefit of both modes,
without the drawbacks of either.
Bazel 6.0 included a number of changes to dynamic execution,
almost all of them behind new experimental flags:

- [Added the `--experimental_dynamic_exclude_tools` flag, which prevents dynamic execution for tools.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9a52a270132250b11523db055e13e69791aecba1)
- [Added the `--experimental_dynamic_local_load_factor` flag, which controls how much load from dynamic execution to put on the local machine.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d5c4f551fa9f5981b36ab67c69386e3787d06f0c)
- [Added the `--experimental_dynamic_slow_remote_time` flag, which starts locally scheduling actions above a certain age in dynamic scheduling.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/88f605c689881f50e8ec310f43878e411936f23c)
- [Added the `--experimental_prioritize_local_actions` flag, which prioritizes local-only actions over dynamically executed actions for local resources.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8fa3ccbb072236a8d0a4937e9e4a0ced58268c25)

[dynamic-execution]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/remote/dynamic

### Local execution

In `buck2`,
[local execution is a specialization of remote execution][buck2-local-execution].
So I'm going to use that as the reason that this section is listed under the "Remote" section,
and not because I don't want to reorganize this post just to fit in a couple neat local execution changes ðŸ˜‰:

- [Announced at BazelCon][skymeld-bazelcon], SkyMeld allows merging the analysis and execution phases with the the [`--experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution` and `--experimental_skymeld_ui` flags](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14057).
- [Local actions now fetch inputs before acquiring the resource lock.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/17276d4fade793955a6f2491e3527c2be184867a)

### Build Event Service (BES)

Using a build event service can give you unparalleled insight into your Bazel builds at scale.
There were some nice changes to BES support,
though I think the improvements to how it interacts with the remote cache are especially noteworthy.

- [Added the `--bep_maximum_open_remote_upload_files` flag, which allows control over the maximum number of open files allowed during BEP artifact upload.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/46104c6948dc4ca66797e413c62b58bd21981c51)
- [Added the `--bes_check_preceding_lifecycle_events` flag, which tells BES to check whether it previously received `InvocationAttemptStarted` and `BuildEnqueued` events matching the current tool event.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/14b5c41c29423866cd3f2ee3f7b69ff48241bd34)
- [Added the `--experimental_build_event_upload_max_retries` and `--experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay` flags, which allow for configuring the behavior of BES uploader retires.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e7218d556a2a265183a10a19fcaa21c0277820ad)
- [Added the `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload` flag, which controls the way Bazel uploads files referenced in BEP to remote caches.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/6b5277294bfcf032d1d2d009c102147af12ec896)
- [BES RPC calls now include request metadata.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/dbcf260e0318ef553d606b0510832cfe8a5b14eb)

## Logging

Bazel offers various methods to gain insight into your build.
I cover some of the notable changes to those methods below.

### Build Event Protocol (BEP)

The build event protocol is used by [build event services](<#build-event-service-(bes)>),
so all of these changes could have also been listed in that section as well.
The BEP can also be collected locally with [`--build_event_json_file`][build_event_json_file] and [`--build_event_binary_file`][build_event_binary_file].

The vast majority of changes added additional information to the BEP,
though some are fixes and improvements:

- [Added the `digest` and `length` fields to `File`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/da6d9499d61ed4fb14a0bbbf456d5e9381c328ee)
- [Added the `BuildMetrics.network_metrics` field.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9bc9096241fb414303cafecd36a993f45117f3e1)
- [Added the `MemoryMetrics.peak_post_gc_tenured_space_heap_size` field.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/a9ac2b6162234c4c1d0db37a6d7b783763d0f79f)
- [Added the `WorkerMetrics.last_action_start_time_in_ms` field.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d233c896fd6eff93901f7dd8641936a76b544ccb)
- [Changed the semantics of `build_event_stream.BuildMetrics.PackageMetrics.packages_loaded` to be the number of packages successfully loaded.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d8c25fcced761cb139e560076d24d9f179055548)
- [Deprecated `AnomalyReport`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/286fb80081db0af43b1f86292ce417c6541d4ad4)

[build_event_binary_file]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--build_event_binary_file
[build_event_json_file]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--build_event_json_file

### Timing profile

The action timing profile,
which is enabled by default with [`--profile`][profile],
is viewable both [locally in Chrome][performance-profiling] and on [build event services](<#build-event-service-(bes)>).
These changes add more detail and clarity to the profile:

- [Added action mnemonics.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e78fd2e5f4cfc4029d4725d764eca0b1abff164b)
- [Added the `--experimental_collect_load_average_in_profiler` flag, which adds the system's overall load average.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b4dbed0c599862cc3886fc644cda95d0a38b4f70)
- [Added the `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` flag, which adds system network usage.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e382cb2fd7b02e557a513f93a58eafd42ab234b0)
- [Added the `--experimental_collect_worker_data_in_profiler` flag, which adds worker memory usage.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/be5354b4b4a27d34badbce0c6540b879c84fd865)
- [Improved reporting of critical path components.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3d2bb2a400c48bc51e43db11ac154d999a97881b)
- [Made the `sort_index` value always a string.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/081f831e3c86b4a4c6d6107b29c4883581b94aee)

[profile]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/reference/command-line-reference#flag--profile

### Execution log

Bazel logs all of the [spawns][spawns] it executes in the execution log,
which is enabled with the [`--execution_log_json_file`][execution_log_json_file] or [`--execution_log_binary_file`][execution_log_binary_file] flags.
This feature is relatively stable,
with just a few noticeable additions:

- [Added the `--experimental_execution_log_spawn_metrics` flag, which causes spawn metrics in be included in the execution log.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b4b8b2614ae854651075506666f109d0fc508ad1)
- [Added the `SpawnExec.digest` field.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b2cbc9a17c90f9ddeb88eca4756cb2fc764abebe)

## Dependency management

A new dependency system named [Bzlmod][bzlmod] was added in Bazel 5.0,
and made non-experimental in Bazel 6.0.
Besides all of the changes needed to support Bzlmod,
these were some other notable dependency management related changes:

- [Added the `--experimental_check_external_repository_files` flag, which allows disabling checking for modifications to files in external repositories.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/123da96ef501457193f6ff52f42522249f5e3737)

## Platforms and toolchains

The C++, Android, and Apple rules are being migrated to support [building with Platforms][building-with-platforms].
While progress has been made,
they don't fully support it yet in Bazel 6.0.
For C++ projects,
it's recommended that the `--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` flag is used,
to help the Bazel team discover any issues in the wide variety of projects that exist.

Here are some of the platforms and toolchains related changes which weren't tied to any of those migrations:

- The `host` configuration is deprecated, and [a](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/6e6c4cf1bd6edaa15ecc4417cd0be70581181def) [lot](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/32fc7cac3c62dcf1721e9093a449561eb854f241) [of](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/790d7a75b34eb963c18f9165bd9608d7a8eb4f3d) [changes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/48e88685105c906ae52865422da01c39c580bf21) [were](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/715c9faabba573501c9cb7604192759950633205) [made](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d988e8b3bace4b2bb2ec4adc17d9bf7b4f49a907) to migrate away from it and to the `exec` configuration.
- [Added the `--incompatible_disable_starlark_host_transitions` flag, which prevents rules from using the `host` configuration.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/6464f1cbdf14f0b8e8f29f7b57990a40ea584062)
- [Added the `--experimental_exec_configuration_distinguisher` flag, which changes how the `platform_suffix` is calculated.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/51c90c7d7f749af99d66cbd21bbdda09b68f79ac)
- [Added the `exec_group` argument to `testing.ExecutionInfo()`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/423fb20c2bc7773f8c9567be8056566ce4633e5f)
- [Toolchain dependencies can now be optional.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14726)
- [`sh` path is now selected based on execution platform instead of host platform, making it possible to execute `sh` actions in multi-platform builds.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/eeb2e04e52cfad165a1bde33ce2d83a392f53d00)
- [The `exec` transition no longer resets any `TestConfiguration.TestOptions` options.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2adf0033bb4e71171e96f95bbd54ab783c6bb6d1)
- [`platform.exec_properties` now become execution requirements.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e4c1c434d49062449c7a83dd753fe01923766b1d)

[building-with-platforms]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/concepts/platforms

## Execution platforms

Execution platforms are [platforms][platforms] which build tools execute on.
These include the host platform on which Bazel runs.

In the following sections I collected notable changes for Linux and macOS.
I'm sure there were some for Windows as well,
but since I don't use Bazel on Windows,
none of the changes stood out to me as pertaining only to it.

[platforms]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/extending/platforms

### Linux

- [Added the `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` flag, which causes the sandbox to have its own dedicated empty directory mounted as `/tmp` rather than sharing `/tmp` with the host filesystem.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ae6a90a143b1ef25ff5fd620c662ab5f81d0043d)

as they still have some functionality provided by Bazel core,
instead of being fully supported by standalone Starlark rules.

### Android

## Rules authoring

Bazel's extensibility is powered by the ability to write custom [rules][rules].
Most rules used in a project will be provided by open source rule sets,
but projects may also define rules themselves.
Bazel 6.0 includes numerous changes that make custom rules more performant,
easier to write,
or even expand what is possible to do with them.

[rules]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/extending/rules

### Aspects

[Aspects][aspects] allow augmenting build dependency graphs with additional information and actions.
These changes expanded their capabilities:

- [Added the `--aspects_parameters` flag, which allows passing parameters to command-line aspects.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/37710728712e00e8bd7145662668d72591204146)

### Persistent workers

[Persistent workers][workers] improve build performance by sending multiple requests to long-running processes.
Here are some notable changes to persistent worker support:

- [Added the `--experimental_total_worker_memory_limit_mb` flag, which sets a limit on total worker memory usage.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8e674324d18b715fd09c7fcfedd97be28caa525c)

### Starlark

[As mentioned at Bazelcon][starlarkification],

## Summary

As you can see,
Bazel 6.0 was another _massive_ release.
Thankfully,
through the [rolling releases][rolling-releases] process,
people were able to test,
or even actively depend on,
these changes well before the first 6.0 release candidate was cut.

I expect [Bazel 6.1][bazel-6-1] to be a fast follow with some changes that missed the final release candidate.
Work on Bazel 7.0 is well underway as well,
and I look forward to summarizing its changes next year.

[bazel-6-1]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/milestone/46
[rolling-releases]: https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/release/versioning#rolling-releases
