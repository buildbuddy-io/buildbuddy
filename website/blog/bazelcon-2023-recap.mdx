Another year, another Bazelcon! This year's edition was held in Munich, Germany, and featured two days of talks by Bazel maintainers, contributers, and users. Among the Bazel users represented as this year's conference were: [Booking.com](https://youtu.be/8Dc8R_Zrf6M?t=28564), [RabbitMQ](https://youtu.be/IXimf4DCAoY?t=22673), [Spotify](https://youtu.be/IXimf4DCAoY?t=25961), [Stripe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dc8R_Zrf6M&t=17680s), [Uber](https://youtu.be/8Dc8R_Zrf6M?t=25010), and more.

Here are some of the highlights:
