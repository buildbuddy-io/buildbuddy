At BuildBuddy, our mission is to bring the world's best developer tools to every company. A big part of that mission involves building a team folks with deep industry experience helping companies build and scale their systems.

That's why we're so excited to share that [**Son Luong Ngoc**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luongngocson/) has joined BuildBuddy as a Solutions Engineer. His work with Bazel at scale will directly benefit BuildBuddy users and customers.

Son Luong is a contributor to [bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asluongng), [git](http://public-inbox.org/git/?q=sluongng), [rules_go](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/pulls?q=author%3Asluongng), [rules_docker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/commits?author=sluongng), [bazel-gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pulls?q=author%3Asluongng), and more. He's also a regular contributor to the [Bazel Slack](https://slack.bazel.build/) and maintains an [incredible blog](https://sluongng.hashnode.dev/) that explains the inner workings of Bazel.
