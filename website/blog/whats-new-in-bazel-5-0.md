[Bazel 5.0][bazel-5-0] includes [nearly 3,000 changes][diff] since 4.2.2.
It's the first major release since 4.0 was release in January of last year,
and it's Bazel's [second LTS release][lts-releases].
Since there were so many changes,
many of them quite impactful,
I felt I needed to review them all and provide a nice summary for y'all.
So that's what I did ðŸ˜„.

[bazel-5-0]: https://blog.bazel.build/2022/01/19/bazel-5.0.html
[diff]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/4.2.2...5.0.0
[lts-releases]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.0.0/versioning.html#lts-releases

<!-- truncate -->

The end result was quite big though,
so I've included a table of contents to allow easy navigation to the changes that interest you the most:

## Command-line flag changes

Bazel's [LTS strategy][lts-releases] allows for breaking changes between major versions.
In particular,
it allows for command-line flags to be removed,
renamed,
made to do nothing,
or have their default values changed.
In the following sections I collected all such flag changes I could find.

### Renamed

- [`--incompatible_use_lexicographical_unordered_output` is now `--incompatible_lexicographical_output`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2ee3c2b3b60462b81a56fa396d5935ce02052f6d)
- [`--experimental_run_validations` is now `--run_validations`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/374cb1f925430c5c75c690ba225f135a6095eb89)
- [`--experimental_existing_rules_immutable_view` is now `--incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/35182000bfc5303254008896481b1350c91c3256)

## Remote

One of Bazel's most powerful features is its ability to use [remote caching and remote execution][remote-explained].
Numerous improvements and fixes to Bazel's remote capabilities are included in Bazel 5.0.

[remote-explained]: bazels-remote-caching-and-remote-execution-explained.md

### gRPC

Bazel uses gRPC as a protocol for most of its remote capabilities.
There were a couple changes that applied at this foundational level:

- [Added mnemonic and label to remote cache and remote execution requests.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/a750a56f8f4061516ec3056ae8a8295ea8279903)
- [Bazel no longer crashes on errors returned while creating a gRPC connection.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b0ae0afd451bbe374be24c905579cece793b90c7)

### Remote caching (RBC)

Using a remote cache is one of the most popular ways of speeding up a Bazel build.
Thankfully these changes make using a remote cache both more performant and more reliable:

- [Added the `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` flag, which compresses gRPC uploads/downloads.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/50274a9f714616d4735a560db7f617e53fb8d01b)
- [Added the `--experimental_remote_cache_async` flag, which makes uploads happen in the background.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/7f08b7841fcf4c7d7d09b69f9ec1f24969aba8a1)
- [Added the `--experimental_remote_merkle_tree_cache` flag, which can speed up action cache hit checking.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3947c836cf0c966882a1524e40fa8c3721ac5b07)
- [Added the `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` flag, which can speed up Remote Build without the Bytes after a Bazel server restart.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/4e29042fd77eae565a711655df6150500cb6e915)
- [Added the `no-remote-cache-upload` tag, which allows downloading, but not uploading, outputs from the remote cache.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/bfc24139d93f8643686d91596ba347df2e01966a)
- [Reduced `FindMissingBlobs` calls when using a combined cache.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/dc32f0b6a5d93e4c4426815cecddbc26c1f5d7ac)
- [`FindMissingBlobs` calls and file uploads are now deduplicated.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/db15e47d0391d904c29e6e5c632089e2479e62c2)
- [Fixed "file not found" errors when remote cache is changed from enabled to disabled.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f94898915268be5670fb1e93a16c03e9b14d2a58)
- [`chmod 0555` is now consistently set on outputs.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/11066c7731b5a16f2f11db93f6716a1595650aad)

### Remote execution (RBE)

For some projects,
using remote execution is the ultimate performance unlock for their Bazel builds.
In addition to the remote caching changes covered above,
which also apply to remote execution,
the following changes improve the remote execution experience:

- [Added the `--experimental_dynamic_skip_first_build` flag, which skips dynamic execution until there has been a successful build.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/1e42b94b1c35eca37f45c58c048b38e20bd812bc)
- [Improved debug output when using the `--experimental_debug_spawn_scheduler` flag.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/060d5966adf2c8035276cd1159601567bea57757)
- [Improved performance of workers when using dynamic execution.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/6080c1e07f4229ea72eacd04faa9302e44955a84)
- [Improved dynamic execution's local execution delay logic.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/04754efc1868df499b63cba341f7c90ad18aa425)
- [The disk cache can now be used with remote execution.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/cf57d036c2e1b608ca902267fbbdfeb7ee5aa166)
- [Target-level `exec_properties` now merge with values from `--remote_default_exec_properties`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/713abde2576d7e3c3b584eed80097cd53c9cf082)
- [Failure messages from remote execution are now propagated.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/399a5beb37a2620c9494f7eef774b99dc7ccab6d)

### Build Event Service (BES)

Using a build event service can give you unparalleled insight into your Bazel builds at scale.
There were some nice changes to BES support,
though I think the improvements to how it interacts with the remote cache are especially noteworthy.

- [Added the `--incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache` flag, which prevents the BES uploader from uploading the outputs of actions that shouldn't be cached remotely.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/bfc24139d93f8643686d91596ba347df2e01966a)
- [Added the `--bes_header` flag, which allows passing extra headers to the BES server.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ef42d1365d0f508d3d817997b5049639a72100ab)
- [Added logging when a blob upload isn't uploaded in time.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/71b50f6b4c6e462863c8433a163c9eb23b0c5730)
- [The `--build_event_binary_file` flag now implies `--bes_upload_mode=wait_for_upload_complete`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/62060babcc26f3cac3db020e423daec8755fd426)
- [BES referenced blobs are no longer stored in the disk cache.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/dc59d9e8f7937f2e317c042e8da8f97ba6b1237e)
- [The BES uploader now uses the same code as the remote cache uploader and is now more robust to errors.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e855a26691daeac81c1e823ad65c7707062e0bd2)
- [Fixed the BES uploader to handle errors in more edge cases.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/c51eb5730745017d008af9a49dcfcc975d7c0283)

## Logging

Bazel offers various ways to gain insight into your build.
It's not too surprising then that there were over 30 changes to these capabilities in Bazel 5.0.

### Build Event Protocol (BEP)

The build event protocol is used by [build event services](#build-event-service-bes),
so all of these changes could have also been listed in that section as well.
The BEP can also be collected locally with [`--build_event_json_file`][build_event_json_file] and [`--build_event_binary_file`][build_event_binary_file].

The vast majority of changes added additional information to the BEP,
though some are fixes and improvements:

- [Added `cumulative_metrics` field to `BuildMetrics`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/77a980f3ec2496d3f952987e3eaf9df8560a114d)

### Timing profile

The action timing profile,
which is enabled by default with [`--profile`][profile],
is viewable both [locally in Chrome][performance-profiling] and on [build event services](#build-event-service-bes).
These changes add more detail and clarity to the profile:

- [Added server heap usage.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f4fbbd653822ef7306f60144515e7ef551b2d39b)
- [Added system CPU and memory metrics.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ec2eda1b56a5197ee2d019f58d89a68b17974b13)

### Execution log

Bazel logs all of the [spawns][spawns] it executes in the execution log,
which is enabled with the [`--execution_log_json_file`][execution_log_json_file] or [`--execution_log_binary_file`][execution_log_binary_file] flags.
This feature is relatively stable,
with just a single noticeable change:

- [Added wall time duration.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f92d80ce649a9abcb3e674a6e7c7eaf3b4f08ecd)

[spawns]: bazels-remote-caching-and-remote-execution-explained.md#spawns

## Query

`bazel build` wasn't the only command to get improvements in this release.
Here are some changes that were made to the `query` family of commands:

- [Added the `--incompatible_lexicographical_output` flag (on by default), which lexicographically sorts the output of `query --order_output=auto`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/acbceddd97fb86dca96d0cd1ec45807335d7f7fc)
- [Added the `--deduplicate_depsets` flag (on by default) to `aquery`, which removes duplicate subsets in `dep_set_of_files`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/28ffaa259e1df63b64940344bb3b72999a8a1de6)
- [Added `--keep_going` functionality to graphless `query`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/a01371abaae4b2329877e25ff13d1a99e35034f1)
- [Added execution platform information to `aquery` output.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/11c09c5254e6dc5e17016a17c345fe374b3d799d)
- [Fixed output of `config_setting` visibility.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/5dfffefef58da0c426cfa0b3d70132dde77950b0)

## Dependency management

A new
(currently experimental)
external dependency system,
codenamed [Bzlmod][bzlmod],
was added in Bazel 5.0.
Besides for all of the changes needed to support Bzlmod,
there was one more notable dependency management related change:

- [Added the `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` flag, which allows Bazel to retry certain repository download errors.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/a1137ec1338d9549fd34a9a74502ffa58c286a8e)

[bzlmod]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.0.0/bzlmod.html

## Platforms and toolchains

The C++, Android, and Apple rules are being migrated to support [building with Platforms][building-with-platforms].
While [progress has been made][platforms-progress],
they don't fully support it yet in Bazel 5.0.
For C++ projects,
it's recommended that the `--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` flag is used,
to help the Bazel team discover any issues in the wide variety of projects that exist.

Here are some of the platforms and toolchains related changes which weren't tied to any of those migrations:

- [Added the `--experimental_platform_in_output_dir` flag, which causes the output dir name to use a non-default platform name instead of the CPU.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/daecf427ec0bf0e963c324783062c4f5b61ff679)
- [`target_compatible_with` can now be used with all non-workspace rules.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/d052ececddf54587c576f876ce13d4b8f4aacb0b)
- [The `--toolchain_resolution_debug` flag now accepts regexes matching targets, as well as toolchain types, when choosing what debug messages to print.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/545befb13a64468377e3792a8f56c67cac245fa1)
- [The toolchain transition is now enabled for all toolchains.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/4b47d6f849bb2eca669f48cfdb5d1796100920f3)
- [Progress is being made on changing all `host` configurations to `exec`.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/8d66a4171baddcbe1569972f019e54130111202c)

## Execution platforms

Execution platforms are [platforms][platforms] which build tools execute on.
These include the host platform on which Bazel runs.

In the following sections I collected notable changes for Linux and macOS.
I'm sure there were some for Windows as well,
but since I don't use Bazel on Windows,
none of the changes stood out to me as pertaining only to it.

[platforms]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.0.0/platforms.html

### Linux

I only noticed a single change that was directly related to Linux execution:

- [Added the `--experimental_use_hermetic_linux_sandbox` flag, which configures `linux-sandbox` to use a `chroot` environment.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/11f7d8040fadc595589ee264561606dc2a83685d)

as they still have some functionality provided by Bazel core,
instead of being fully supported by standalone Starlark rules.

## Languages

While there are lots of programming languages that are supported through standalone Starlark rules,
some are still written as "native" rules in Bazel core,
or are bundled Starlark rules while [Starlarkification](#starlark) is in progress.
In the following sections I summarize the notable changes in support of these languages.

### C and C++

## Rules authoring

Bazel's extensibility is powered by the ability to write custom [rules][rules].
Most rules used in a project will be provided by open source rule sets,
but projects may also define rules themselves.
Bazel 5.0 includes numerous changes that make custom rules more performant,
easier to write,
or even expand what is possible to do with them.

[rules]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.0.0/skylark/rules.html

### Aspects

[Aspects][aspects] allow augmenting build dependency graphs with additional information and actions.
These changes expanded their capabilities:

- [Added the `--experimental_enable_aspect_hints` flag,](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/60ebb105dbf34f0b267ea7573157246b4c9bfcaf) [which adds the `aspect_hints` attribute to rules.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/a2856bf66f4b4c519861a994c6e09bd263f2a31e)
- [Added the `--experimental_required_aspects` flag, which allows aspects to depend on other aspects.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/f8c34080de1f9b935e3f6abf23b2a319e62c9052)
- [Added the `--incompatible_top_level_aspects_dependency` flag, which allows top-level aspect dependencies.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/ed251187b078c4262bbbc1da72015ce12f9964f4)
- [When using the `--allow_analysis_failures` flag (for example, via `bazel-skylib`'s `analysistest` with `expect_failure = True`), analysis-time failures in aspect implementation functions will now be propagated and saved in `AnalysisFailureInfo`, just like analysis-time failures in rules.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/020dd5f1ee9c2c388644dbcd45cda4ebf6b42876)

[aspects]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.0.0/skylark/aspects.html

### Persistent workers

[Persistent workers][workers] improve build performance by sending multiple requests to long-running processes.
Here are some notable changes to persistent worker support:

- [Added support for worker cancellation.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e0d6f8b00490a5e7973e74680e9e0ca3f19dc6e1)
- [Added the `verbosity` field to the worker protocol, primarily controlled by the `--worker_verbose` flag.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/40d33638c4abd0860006253b922e362bae05a238)
- [JSON based workers now have their requests formatted according to the ndjson spec.](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/299e50aae9d8c0b7f0d47aa2ce3d2658a3a80a94)

### Starlark

[As mentioned at Bazelcon][starlarkification],
progress is being made on migrating natives rules out of Bazel and into standalone Starlark rules.
In the Bazel 5.0 release progress was made on the Android, C++, Java, and Objective-C rules.

In addition to changes directly needed for Starlarkification,
for which there were many and I'm not going to list them here,
the Starlark language itself received performance and feature improvements:

## Misc

There were a handful of changes that I couldn't find a nice home for in the sections above,

## Summary

As you can see,
Bazel 5.0 was a _massive_ release.
Thankfully,
through the [rolling releases][rolling-releases] process,
people were able to test,
or even actively depend on,
these changes well before the first 5.0 release candidate was cut.

I expect Bazel 5.1 to be a fast follow with some changes that missed the final release candidate.
Work on Bazel 6.0 is well underway as well,
and I look forward to summarizing its changes later this year.
