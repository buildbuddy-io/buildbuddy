Our mission at BuildBuddy is to help developers be more productive. It's our highest priority to make sure that your data is safe so that you can focus on what matters: building your product.

Today, we’re excited to share that BuildBuddy has achieved SOC 2 certification.

The audit was conducted by [The Cadence Group](https://thecadencegroup.com/), compliance specialists who have performed SOC reporting examinations for some of the largest software companies in the world. Our certification means that we adhere to the highest standards of security, processing integrity, and risk management.

Our SOC 2 Report outlines how we encrypt our customer’s data, control access to our systems, scan for vulnerabilities, respond to incidents, and more.

In addition to completing our SOC 2 audit, we've partnered with [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com/products/soc-2) to continuously monitor our SOC 2 compliance and ensure that the security practices we've put in place are being followed.

We’re happy to discuss our security policies in more detail or send over a copy of our SOC 2 report. Please feel free to reach out to us at [security@buildbuddy.io](mailto:security@buildbuddy.io) for more information!
