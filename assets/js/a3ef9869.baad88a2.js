Our implementation cuts a corner here in that we never decrement the action merging reference count.

Initially, we chalked this up to different traffic patterns, but after digging in, Brandon noticed our action merging Redis client was configured to read and write action merging state from a single Redis shard instead of the entire Redis deployment.

If a primary execution fails due to a flake, all merged executions will fail too. We would like to use the information we already have about flaky tests to merge and hedge actions more intelligently.
