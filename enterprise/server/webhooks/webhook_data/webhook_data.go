	// PushedBranch is the name of the branch in the source repo that triggered the

	// name in the forked repository, and the TargetBranch references the branch in
	// the main repository into which the PushedBranch will be merged.
	//
	// Some examples:
	//
	// Push main branch (e.g. `git push main` or merge a PR into main):
	// - RepoURL: "https://github.com/example/example.git"
	// - PushedBranch: "main" // in "example/example" repo
	// - TargetBranch: "main" // in "example/example" repo
	//
	// Push to a PR branch within the mainline repo:
	// - RepoURL: "https://github.com/example/example.git"
	// - PushedBranch: "foo-feature" // in "example/example" repo
	// - TargetBranch: "main"        // in "example/example" repo
	//
	// Push to a PR branch within a forked repo:
	// - RepoURL: "https://github.com/some-user/example-fork.git"
	// - PushedBranch: "bar-feature" // in "some-user/example-fork" repo
	// - TargetBranch: "main"        // in "example/example" repo

	// TargetBranch is the branch associated with the event that determines whether
	// actions should be triggered. For push events this is the branch that was
	// pushed to. For pull_request events this is the base branch into which the PR
	// branch is being merged.
	TargetBranch string
	// RepoURL points to the canonical repo URL containing the sources needed for the
	// workflow.
	//
	// This will be different from the workflow repo if the workflow is run on a forked
	// repo as part of a pull request.
	RepoURL string
	// SHA of the commit to be checked out.
	SHA string
	// IsRepoPrivate returns whether the repo is private.
